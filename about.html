    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I'm Gorazd Nanevski, a first-year software engineering student at FINKI, currently exploring front-end development, mobile apps, and creative tech. I'm passionate about building intuitive experiences that feel as good as they look.
    </p>

    <h2>ðŸŽ¸ Music</h2>
    <p>
      Outside of code, I play guitar and produce music for <strong>Basement Cult</strong> â€” a band blending math rock, post-hardcore, and cinematic textures. We've released an EP and performed in local festivals and venues across Macedonia.
    </p>

    <h2>ðŸ’» What I'm Building</h2>
    <p>
      Right now, Iâ€™m working on a React Native app called <strong>Kade.mk</strong>, designed to help users find the perfect vibe for food, drinks, or coffee around Skopje. Itâ€™s my first serious dive into mobile app development.
    </p>

    <h2>ðŸš€ Vision</h2>
    <p>
      I want to create software that empowers people and culture â€” whether itâ€™s through tech startups, music tools, or creative platforms. Eventually, I want to found something meaningful that combines all of it.
